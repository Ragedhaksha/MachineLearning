# LinearRegression

A Fun Project - Using LinearRegression, Predicting the Values.

This is just a fun project. I have made a Dataset, where has a Year column and the Price of a land column and using LinearRegression, I am predicting the price of that land in any future year!!

This Project will teach you the application of LinearRegression and concept of Machine Learning.

## Libraries Required

1. [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html).

```
$ pip install scikit-learn
```

2. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

```
$ pip install pandas
```

## How It Works & Runs

Install the above Libraries and make sure you are on Python3(https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/). Go to the main.py file and change the path of the file directory of LandData.xlsx file and Enter the Year of which you want to predict the Land Price. Save the file and Run the file.
